drunken-hipster
===============

drunken-hipster is a WebSocket-aware SSL-capable HTTP reverse proxy/load balancer.

Building
--------

First, make sure you have the Go build environment correctly installed. See http://golang.org/
for more information.

Then run "make". This will in turn call the go utility to build the load balancer, resulting
in a binary named hipsterd.


Configuration
-------------

WIP. In the meanwhile, take a look at the examples in the examples subdirectory.
